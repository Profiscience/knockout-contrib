       * These tell tsc to ignore the "types" property in the package.json
       * of cross dependencies, since when running tsc on the entire repo at
       * once those declaration files may not exist yet, and if they do they
       * may be outdated. Also, if you editor has good TS support, you may opt
       * not to run the type checker as part of the build (i.e. `--transpile-only`),
       * in which case the declarations will not be built.
       *
       * This was a major headache to figure out, and until (if?) Typescript implements
       * some sort of project/composite compilation, it's likely the best option without
       * incurring the massive expense of reverting the build process to run tsc in each
       * package individually.
